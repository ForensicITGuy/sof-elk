# This is a sample Filebeat prospector file that looks into the /logstash/logtype/ directory for files to load.
# These are sent to localhost:5044, where Logstash is listening.
# To use this, make a copy, rename and remove the .sample extension and change "logtype" as needed.  Create the
# parent directory in /logstash/ and chmod it to 1777.
